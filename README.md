# Recommender-System-using-ALS-with-Apache-Spark-and-Python
In this project, we create a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. We create this system using Spark and the collaborative filtering technique.
A more detailed description of the project and actual methods implemented are included in the recommender_ALS_Spark_Python notebook.
